# Vision For Vision - Image to Speech Translation

## Abstract

The problem we are trying to solve is providing access to digital images for the visually impaired. In 2015, 253 million people were estimated as visually impaired worldwide [3]. They had limited access to the digital world as most of it is reliant on sight. However, one way that visually impaired people navigate the internet is through text to speech applications.
